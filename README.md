# TriviaGame

## Description
This was a trivia game using skills we've learned up to week five of class. We were to focus on timers and timeouts in Javascript. On page load, user will click the Start button to begin the trivia. Each question is displayed one at a time, with a 15 second countdown clock. Each question is multiple choice and only allowed to have one answer.

If answer is correct, the page automatically goes to the answer page and says you're right. If answer is incorrect, the page automatically goes to the answer page and gives correct answer. If user fails to answer the question before times runs out, the page automatically goes to the answer page and give correct answer. The page will automatically move to the next question.

At the end of the game, a scoreboard will list correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions. A start over button will start the game over without reload.

## How it was built
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery. Experimented with a giphy API.
